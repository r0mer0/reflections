How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Maybe it's a typo, so you can easily fix it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Many problems can occur again, so we may search through the versions and find out how to solve similar problems.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

When I choose when to create a commit I can do it every logical change made in the program. Automatically saving can save many commits that I didn't make any change or lose some important changes that would be necessary to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because it works offline into the directory (repository).

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use git log in the repository folder to view all the commit changes made. Use git diff to compare two different commits.

Should not be doing an octopus 
Octopus is a strategy Git uses to combine many different versions of code together. This message can appear if you try to use this strategy in an inappropriate situation.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state 
HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can “detach” the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next video. Despite what it sounds like, it’s actually not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

With version control I can go back to a earlier point before make the bug.
