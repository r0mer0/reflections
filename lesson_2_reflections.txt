What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, a mark master appears in the bash and a folder .git is created. I need to do it to show what folders I want to turn on a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

This is the middle term between a working directory (directory with many random files) and a repository (files already commited belonging to my project). It offers a safe value.
